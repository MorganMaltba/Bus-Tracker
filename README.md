# Bus-Tracker
### Tracks buses in real-time using MBTA data!

**Description**: <br>
This project imports data from [MBTA](https://api-v3.mbta.com/vehicles?filter[route]=1&include=trip).<br>
For each bus, it generates a marker on the map at the position of the bus via the longitude and latitude provided by the data.

**How to Run**: <br>
1. To run locally, download all files into the same directory, and open the Bus Tracker.HTML file in your browser. <br>
2. To see it in action, go to [My Project Page](https://morganmaltba.github.io/Bus-Tracker/)!

**Roadmap of future improvements**: <br> 
Future improvements include updated icons that change dependent on whether bus is stationary or in motion.
